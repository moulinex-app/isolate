# isolate-lib

This fork of **isolate** is a dynamic library based on the work of Martin Mare≈° (<mj@ucw.cz>) and Bernard Blackham
(<bernard@blackham.com.au>) on [isolate](https://github.com/ioi/isolate), it exposes API bindings for the Rust crate
that is made for Moulinex. See the original repository for the CLI.

## Install from source

To compile and install **isolate-lib** you will need the following dependencies :
